# eCabs coding challenge

## Assumptions
* I'm assuming fire and forget approach - API endpoint is publishing message and not waiting for confirmation, returning HTTP 202 Accepted because data will be processed later in consumer
* I'm assuming that client application is holding the state of booking, and is able to use generated UUIDs for PUT and DELETE operations

## Solution

### Modules
* booking-producer-service - Implements API, basic validation and produce RabbitMQ messages.
* booking-consumer-service - Implements RabbitMQ listeners, "business logic" and persistence.
* booking-contract - contains DTO objects and Consts shared between both applications. This module is communication contract.

### Known issues/limitations
* error handling is limited to bare minimum - real world application should handle much more edge cases based on requirement
* only integration test provided - because application has almost no business logic I provided only integration tests. Test coverage is > 80%.
* faulty, not processed messages are redirected to Dead Letter Queue 

### Endpoints documentation
Endpoints documentation is generated on the fly in OpenAPI format by booking-producer-service
